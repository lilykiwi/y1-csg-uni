# Notes for DD-V2

## Raw

- feature idea from ikaruga/titanfall 2/subspace emissary: time hop multi gameplay board thing
- feature idea from space run galaxy: ship building that lets you diagetically control difficulty by speeding up / slowing down. could be interesting to implement
- control system with positioning
- powerup system where you combine enemy drops to get more powerful (combos)
- puzzle elements
- dialogue system dice roll
- furi: dodge,counter/parry, charge up, boss phases, tiered health bars
- clear projectile types archetypical: **health, generic, spread, unavoidable**
- destructable obstacles
- single-use powerups - time slow, extra damage, damage reduction
- boss damage zones
- narrative
- out-of-game upgrade system
- physics
- level/course editor
- endless (score attack) mode
- time attack mode
- roguelite with multiple paths, link back to the control system with positioning idea. warp gates? direction you go controls the difficulty, enemy types, unlock types, encounter types, boss, etc. plus longer term progression there.
